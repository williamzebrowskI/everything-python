Big-O notation used to describe algorithm performance.

This notation format is used to describe how a particular algorithm performs 
as the size of the set of input grows over time. And the reason the letter O is 
used is because the growth rate of an algorithm's time complexity is also referred to 
as the order of operation. 

This is just a test.  There is no need to panic.  We are here and we are safe.
