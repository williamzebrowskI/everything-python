IMPORTANT:  NEXT STEPS TO FINISH YOUR FOOD STAMPS A PPLICATION
  
 
You’re almost finished! Your application has been s ubmitted to your 
local County Assistance Office. 
 
Before you can receive benefits you must:
  
 
1. COMPLETE AN INTERVIEW WITH A CASE WORKER. 
 
A case worker should contact you to schedule an int erview. This can be done in-
person or over the phone. You may receive a letter  in the mail with the time and 
date of your interview, or you may just receive a c all from a case worker. If you do 
not hear from your case worker  in two weeks, call  and tell them: “I need to 
schedule an interview for my food stamp application .” 
 
Ask for this information when you speak to a case worker: 
 
• The name of the case worker:______________________ 
• Your case worker’s phone number: __________________ 
• Your Record Number”: ___________________________ 
• “Do you have all the documents you need from me?” 
• ”Can you mail me my EBT card?”  
 
2. MAKE SURE THE LOCAL COUNTY ASSISTANCE OFFICE HAS AL L OF 
YOUR DOCUMENTS 
 
Review the checklist that came with this form to se e if you are still missing any 
documents. You can mail, fax or drop off your docume nts to the local County 
Assistance Office. If you drop them off, make sure  you ask for a receipt.  
 

The local County Assistance Office must help you ge t your documents! If you 

do  not  have  a  required  document,  you  may  be  able  to   use  a  “collateral 

contact.” A collateral contact is someone who can g ive reliable information 

about you, such as an employer, a neighbor, a landl ord, or a social service 

agency. 
Note: You may get a letter saying you are not eligible fo r “expedited” benefits. This 
is not
 a food stamp denial letter. Make sure to complete  the steps above. You 
should hear a response from your local County Assis tance Office within 30 days.
